to calibrate the scales run the ScaleCalibration Sketch.
change the pin numbers on line 16 and 17 to match your set up.
you will want to run this calibration seperately for each scale. your calibration number should be put into the CornerScales Sketch
starting with line 33 where we define the scale1Calibration variable.

to find the calibration number you will run the calibration sketch.
open the Serial Monitor and use 57600 baud.
it will ask you to remove weight then add a known weght.
it will then spit out a number you take this number divide it by the known weight and that will be your calibration factor.
so calibration factor = (reading) /( known weight)

we plug our calibration factor into the CornerScales sketch on line 33,37,41, and 45 for the "scale*calibration" variable for each scale.
