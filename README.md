# WACornerScales
Corner Scales Arduino Project Based on tfunders project.
(tfunders links https://grassrootsmotorsports.com/forum/grm/diy-arduino-corner-weights/186240/page1/  https://github.com/tfunder/Corner-Weights)

This project uses an Arduino Nano Every and 4x400KG load cells to create corner weight scales for a full sized car. (if you need more or less wieght you should be able to use any size load cell that works for your project.)
check out the youtube video of the process setting it up here: YOUTUBE VIDEO LINK.
this Github page will not go over creating the scales themselves just the wiring and sketch info.
